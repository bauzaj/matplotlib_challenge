**Project Title**

Tumor Volume Analysis

**Project Description**

This project analyzes tumor volume data from a study conducted on mice. The goal of the analysis is to calculate summary statistics for each drug regimen used in the study.

**Analysis**

Capomulin & Ramicane were the most heavily used drug regimen which each being used over 200 timepoints during the duration of the trial.

This higher usage lead to a mean Tumor Vol being noticibly lower than the rest of the frug regimens.

With the gender split being 51% / 49%, there does not seem to be a noticible difference in drug performance based on gender.

The data shows that there is a correlation between mouse weight (g) and average tumor volume (mm3).
